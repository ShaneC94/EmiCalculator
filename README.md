# General Guidelines  
Throughout the lectures, we have explored best practices for mobile app development, 
particularly those specific to the Android platform. A portion of your grade will reflect how 
effectively you apply these practices. Additionally, you are expected to follow general 
coding standards, such as using clear and appropriate names for variables and methods 
and writing sufficiently documented code. This does not mean every line needs a 
comment, but key functionalities should be explained at a high level.

## Description 
Many people find it hard to balance mortgage Equated Monthly Installment (EMI), 
monthly income, and expenses. A single miscalculation can affect their ability to save or 
even meet essential needs. To solve this, design an app that helps users calculate 
EMIs, track expenses, and plan savings. 

The app should calculate EMI, add monthly expenses and income, and show the user 
the amount they are saving monthly or the monthly deficit. 

## Core Features: 
### EMI calculator 
- Input: loan amount, interest rate, tenure 
- Output: monthly EMI 
  
### Income and Expense input 
- Users can enter their monthly income 
- Users can enter their monthly expenses (adding daily, recurrent expenses 
is recommended but optional) 

### Budget Balance 
- After subtracting  EMI + expenses, the app should show the remaining 
savings/deficit 

### The UI 
- The app should have a simple and user-friendly UI that effectively cover 
the above aspects
